## Introduction  
Image similarity metrics are often used in image quality assessment for performance
evaluation of image restoration and reconstruction algorithms. They require two images:
 - test image (image of interest)
 - reference image (image we compare against)  
Such metrics produce numerical value.
 
Such methods are are widely called full/reduced-reference methods for 
assessing image quality.

`compimg` package is all about calculating similarity between images. 
It provides image similarity metrics (PSNR, SSIM etc.) that are widely used 
to asses image quality.

## Features  
- common metrics for calculating similarity of one image to another 
- only `numpy` as a dependency

## Installation
`compimg` is available on PyPI. You can install it using pip:  
`pip install compimg`
